## Problem Statement: Modernizing Medical Document Management (Prescriptions and Reports) for Enhanced Healthcare Access

The challenge at hand pertains to the cumbersome task of carrying physical prescriptions and medical reports to doctors while visiting for an appointment. This long-standing practice not only annoys patients but also creates logistical challenges, particularly for seniors who frequently manage a plethora of hard-copy medical documents. This inefficiency of the healthcare system increases the potential risk of documents being lost or misplaced. This unwanted hustle gives a lot of stress and physical burden to elderly people, who may already face mobility issues. 

The nature of this problem is not just limited to patients but extends to Healthcare providers as well, notably doctors and their medical staff. As they must sift through loads of documents during appointments, this practice introduces inefficiencies into their workflow and could delay access to vital patient data and impede the effectiveness of consultations. These reports can manifest errors in the diagnosis process as they are prone to wear and tear in the long term.

Delayed Diagnosis, redundant tests, suboptimal treatment plans, and fragmented care are some of the many repercussions that patients have to deal with due to the lack of a proper and efficient Medical record management system.

## Proposed Solution
So while addressing this problem comprehensively, we sought a solution that caters to the diverse needs of patients while aligning with the technological advancements of our time.

#### Here is our Big Idea!

Digitizing Healthcare Records for Streamlined Access

To cater to this problem we propose the development of a vigorous digital platform with two key components: a patient portal and a doctor's portal.

Patient Portal â€“ It offers the ability for individuals to scan, upload, and securely store their medical documents, all consolidated under a unique patient ID. The switch to digital records improves accessibility for patients of all ages, including the elderly, while also getting rid of the hassle of physical paperwork.

The patient portal goes one step further by offering users a condensed view of essential medical data. For example - When you scan or upload a blood test report. Crucial report markers such as Hemoglobin level, Blood group, and Blood sugar are presented visually for better understanding.

Doctor's Portal â€“ It provides effective access to patient records by just entering the unique patient ID, ensuring speedy past diagnosis information retrieval and streamlining consultations. 

Our solution transforms the healthcare experience by providing patients and healthcare professionals with digital tools. In the long run, it supports better healthcare outcomes for all, encourages patient engagement, lowers administrative burdens, and increases the effectiveness of healthcare delivery.
